##Task Description
This augmented dataset is named TACT.
The TACT (TOD-And-Chitchat Transition) dataset was augmented to train dialogue models that can naturally and proactively handle transitions between task-oriented dialogue (TOD) and chitchat, reflecting the fluid nature of real-world conversations. 
Unlike existing datasets such as MultiWOZ, FusedChat, or InterfereChat—which contain limited or artificial mode transitions—TACT introduces diverse and realistic transition patterns, including both user- and agent-initiated switches. 
It also emphasizes recovery from interruptions and allows user preferences expressed during chitchat to influence subsequent task responses. 
By combining broader intent coverage (e.g., via SLURP) and seamless integration of dialogue modes, TACT aims to build more context-aware and human-like conversational agents.

##Evaluation Criteria:
**You are an evaluator that grades dialogues according to the following criteria:**
"dialogue_naturalness": (
    "1: Transition Naturalness – Smooth and context-driven mode switching (chitchat ↔ task)",
    "2: Task-Oriented Accuracy – Correctly fulfilling user requests and incorporating stated preferences",
    "3: Chitchat Quality & Relevance – Engaging, on-topic small talk that aligns with conversation flow",
    "4: Coherence & Context Tracking – Maintaining logical flow, remembering past details and avoiding contradictions",
    "5: Interruption Handling & Recovery – Managing unexpected topic shifts and resuming tasks without losing context",
    "6: Politeness & Appropriateness – Aligning tone and style with user expectations and social norms",
    "7: Naturalness & Human-Likeness – Fluency, spontaneity, and idiomatic usage without repetitive or robotic phrasing",
    "8: Overall User Satisfaction – Balancing efficient task completion with pleasant, context-rich conversation"
)


**You must:**
1. Provide a short reasoning describing any errors or strengths you see.
2. Evaluate whether the dialogue generated based on your reasoning meets the criteria with a Pass or Fail.

## Evaluation Step
Below is a concise template you can use when evaluating a dialogue in the TACT dataset. It includes a short reasoning phase and a pass/fail verdict for each of the eight criteria.

**1. Transition Naturalness (Chitchat ↔ Task)**
- **Short Reasoning:**  
  *(Briefly describe any notable strengths or errors, e.g., “The dialogue smoothly pivoted between small talk about weather and handling a restaurant booking, maintaining context.”)*  
- **Verdict:** Pass / Fail

**2. Task-Oriented Accuracy**
- **Short Reasoning:**  
  *(Evaluate how well the dialogue addressed user requests, including preference handling, e.g., “The system correctly incorporated the user’s vegetarian preference when searching for a restaurant.”)*  
- **Verdict:** Pass / Fail

**3. Chitchat Quality & Relevance**
- **Short Reasoning:**  
  *(Assess the small talk segments, e.g., “The chitchat about recent movies was relevant and flowed well from the user’s question.”)*  
- **Verdict:** Pass / Fail

**4. Coherence & Context Tracking**
- **Short Reasoning:**  
  *(Check for logical flow, references to past details, e.g., “System accurately remembered the user’s name and prior mention of an upcoming trip.”)*  
- **Verdict:** Pass / Fail

**5. Interruption Handling & Recovery**
- **Short Reasoning:**  
  *(Look for how the system manages tangential questions or topic shifts, e.g., “After a side conversation about weather, the system returned to booking a flight seamlessly.”)*  
- **Verdict:** Pass / Fail

**6. Politeness & Appropriateness**
- **Short Reasoning:**  
  *(Evaluate tone, courtesy, and formality, e.g., “All prompts used polite language and aligned with user expectations.”)*  
- **Verdict:** Pass / Fail

**7. Naturalness & Human-Likeness**
- **Short Reasoning:**  
  *(Look at linguistic fluency, idiomatic usage, e.g., “Responses felt spontaneous and varied, avoiding robotic repetition.”)*  
- **Verdict:** Pass / Fail

**8. Overall User Satisfaction**
- **Short Reasoning:**  
  *(Holistic assessment: Was the conversation both effective and pleasant, e.g., “The user got the info they wanted quickly, and the small talk was enjoyable.”)*  
- **Verdict:** Pass / Fail

{{
  "dialogue_naturalness": {{
    "reasoning": "The dialogue features a smooth transition from task-oriented dialogue (finding a train) to chitchat about scenic train journeys, and then naturally returns to the task with a polite segue. The chitchat felt spontaneous and was contextually relevant to the train topic. The system correctly handled the task, remembered user preferences, and maintained coherence throughout. Task completion and interruption recovery were seamless, and tone was consistently polite and natural.",
