##Task Description
This augmented dataset is named TACT.
The TACT (TOD-And-Chitchat Transition) dataset was augmented to train dialogue models that can naturally and proactively handle transitions between task-oriented dialogue (TOD) and chitchat, reflecting the fluid nature of real-world conversations. 
Unlike existing datasets such as MultiWOZ, FusedChat, or InterfereChat—which contain limited or artificial mode transitions—TACT introduces diverse and realistic transition patterns, including both user- and agent-initiated switches. 
It also emphasizes recovery from interruptions and allows user preferences expressed during chitchat to influence subsequent task responses. 
By combining broader intent coverage (e.g., via SLURP) and seamless integration of dialogue modes, TACT aims to build more context-aware and human-like conversational agents.


##Evaluation Criteria
**You are an evaluator reviewing a dialogue between a user and a system. Each user utterance is annotated with an intent tag. Your task is to evaluate whether the assigned intent tag for each user utterance is appropriate and accurate.**
- Consider the meaning of each user utterance in context.
- Assess whether the annotated intent correctly reflects what the user is trying to do or ask.
- Refer to the list of candidate intents to determine correctness.
- Provide reasoning for each evaluation to support your decision.

##Notes
- An intent is considered accurate if it clearly aligns with the user's intent in that turn.
- Mark each evaluation as either pass (if the intent is correct) or fail (if the intent is incorrect or ambiguous).

**input_example**
8 [USER] [book_restaurant] I am interested in making a reservation for 6 people at 18:00 on Saturday at a moderately priced restaurant.
9 [SYSTEM] Sounds like you have a fun evening planned, let me make sure we have the right place for you all. Any preference on price range?
10 [USER] [book_restaurant] I would like a moderately priced restaurant please.
11 [SYSTEM] I have booked you successfully at Jinling Noodle Bar on Saturday at 18:00. Your reference number is 2MOF0BGV. Is there anything else I could help you with?
12 [USER] [book_train] I also want a train to go to Stansted airport.
