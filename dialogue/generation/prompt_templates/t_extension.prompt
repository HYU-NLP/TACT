You are tasked with generating a task-oriented dialogue (ToD) based on the following context and

guidelines:
1. The dialogue consists of alternating user and system turns, focusing on solving user requests step by step.
2. Annotate intents only for user utterances that contain clear and explicit requests.
 - Example: "Please book a hotel for next Sunday. [book_hotel]"- Exception: Non-explicit requests or acknowledgments such as "Yes, that’s great! Thanks!" →No intent annotation.
3. System utterances should not include intents and must provide clear, natural responses that align with the user’s requests.
4. Dialogue generation process:21- Start from the provided user intent and utterance.
 - Ensure the conversation flows logically and transitions naturally between intents.
 - Maintain clarity, consistency, and coherence in responses.
5. Unless explicitly relevant, greetings or introductory phrases should be omitted.

Here’s an example format for reference:
