Instruction:
You are given a MultiWOZ-style conversation that primarily aims to complete a specific user request(e.g., finding or booking a hotel, booking a train, etc.).  Your task is to insert user chit-chat in a way that feels natural and non-intrusive—like a side remark about personal preferences or mild curiosities weak-related to the ongoing task.

This chit-chat should:
• Not be framed as an entirely new request (i.e., no large detours from the main goal).
• Not overshadow the main task-oriented dialogue (ToD).
• Still offer extra insights or preferences that the system can leverage to provide a slightly better or more personalized solution.

Guidelines:
1. One chit-chat block should consist of at least four outputs (User ×2, System ×2).
2. In at least one chit-chat turn, the user must reveal a preference or curiosity regarding the task context (e.g., “I like places with a quiet lounge” or “I wonder if there’s a nice bakery nearby”).
3. The system should acknowledge or briefly elaborate on at least one of these chit-chat turns, maintaining a light and relevant tone.
4. After the chit-chat block, the system must use the newly revealed user preference(s) in subsequent ToD steps—demonstrating that the side remark influenced the final recommendation or solution.
5. The conversation must end on a system turn; there should be no user turn following the system’s final message.
6. The original order of the conversation’s existing turns must remain intact. Insert the new[chitchat] turns at appropriate points within the conversation.
7. Transition sentences must appear both before and after the inserted chit-chat block. In a ToD-to-Chat transition, the user initiates the change; in a Chat-to-ToD transition, the system initiates the change and includes the [Transition to ToD] token.
8. Each transition sentence should facilitate a natural flow between the dialogue segments.
9. When transitioning from chit-chat to ToD, the sentence must clearly indicate the change by inserting the [Transition to ToD] token.

Format Requirements:
Each turn in the conversation should adhere to the following format:
"turn_number  [USER or SYSTEM]  [INTENT or none] utterance“
Where:
• turn_number: A consecutive integer (0, 1, 2, . . . ).
• [USER] or [SYSTEM]: Identifies the speaker.
• [INTENT or none]: For user turns, this might include labels like [find_restaurant] or[book_hotel]; chit-chat turns should be labeled [chitchat] (or [none] if no intent is as-signed).
• utterance: The actual textual content of the turn.

Key Requirements for Reflection in ToD:
1. Acknowledgment and Connection: Preferences or curiosities revealed during chit-chat must influence subsequent task-oriented dialogue. This should appear as direct references (e.g., “I found a hotel with a quiet lounge, as you mentioned liking calm spaces”) or adapted solutions.
2. Enhanced Recommendations: The chit-chat should serve to enhance the personalization of the system’s recommendations, offering an additional layer of user-oriented refinement.
3. Natural Flow: Ensure any off-topic remarks remain only weakly related to the main task. Transitions should smoothly reconnect the chit-chat insights to the ongoing task-oriented dialogue.
