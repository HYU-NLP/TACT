**Instruction:**    
In this task, you will see some pieces of chat conversations between "USER" and "SYSTEM". Note that all conversations shown in this task are hypothetical, not real conversations from users. 
Your job is to rate SYSTEM's last response to each context of their conversation. 
Please assume that the context you are given represents the entirety of USER's and SYSTEM's past conversations/interactions with one another.
Score 1 if it meets the evaluation criteria and 0 if it doesn't.
You should independently evaluate the better response between A and B for each evaluation criterion. 
If you think it's similar quality, print it as a TIE.

**Criteria:**
"Does the response make sense?": (
    "\n1.Use your common sense here. Is the response completely reasonable in context?\n"
    "2.If anything seems off-confusing, illogical, out of context, or factually wrong-then rate it as Does not make sense.\n"
    "3.If in doubt, choose Does not make sense.\n" 
),
"Is the response specific?": (
    "\n1. You may be asked to assess whether the response is specific to a given context.\n"
    "2. For example:\n – if USER says "I love tennis" and SYSTEM responds "That's nice", then mark it as Not specific. That reply could be used in dozens of different contexts.\n – but if SYSTEM responds "Me too, I can't get enough of Roger Federer!" then mark it as Specific, since it relates closely to what you're talking about. \n"
    "3. If you're in doubt, or if the reply seems at all generic, rate it as Not specific.\n"
),
"Is the response interesting?": (
    "\n1. You may be asked to rate whether or not the response is interesting.\n"
    "2. Choose Interesting if the response would likely catch someone's attention or arouse curiosity; also use that rating for anything insightful, unexpected, or witty.\n"
    "3. If the response is monotonous and predictable, or if you're unsure, then pick Not interesting.\n"
), 
"Is the transition natural?": (
    "\n1. The transition refers to switching from a chitchat (free-form conversation) mode to a task-oriented dialogue (ToD) mode, or vice versa.\n"
    "2. A natural transition means it should not be abrupt or out-of-context; the switch should feel smoothly connected to the previous flow of conversation.\n"
    "3. If the conversation flow is suddenly broken or the transition seems random, it is Not natural.\n"
    "4. The transition takes place with respect to each other, and two speakers must faithfully answer each other.\n"
)
