3. Generate a response that is appropriate for the user's last utterance.  Keep your responses short. Answer with one sentence.

   ###Conversation### 
     User: Set an alarm for twelve.
     Agent: Got it! Setting an alarm for 12:00 PM. Would you like me to set a recurring alarm for this time?
     User: Yes, please set it to repeat every day.
     Agent: Your alarm for 12:00 PM will now repeat every day. Is there anything else you need help with?
     User: Can you confirm that the alarm is set?
     Agent: Your daily alarm for 12:00 PM is successfully set. Would you like to know how to turn it off or change the time?
     User: Yes, how do I turn it off?
     Agent: You can turn off the alarm by saying \"turn off the alarm\" or by accessing the alarm settings in your device. Would you like me to turn it off for you now?
     User: Yes, please turn it off.
     Agent: The alarm for 12:00 PM has been turned off. Is there anything else you would like assistance with?
     User: You know, I always find it a bit tricky to remember to turn off alarms. Do you have any tips for keeping track of them?
     Agent: It can be challenging! One tip is to set reminders a few minutes before the alarm goes off, so you have a heads-up. Some people also find it helpful to use a dedicated app for managing alarms and reminders.
     User: That’s a good idea! I might try setting a reminder a few minutes before. I also like to have a little note on my desk to remind me of important tasks."  
   ###Output###  
    Intent: chitchat
    Transition tag: [Transition to ToD]
    Response : Having a physical note can be a great visual reminder! Now, would you like me to set a reminder for your important tasks as well?
